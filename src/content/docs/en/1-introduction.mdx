## What you will learn

In this glassy hour you will learn how to:

- Build and deploy a Solana program (Smart Contract) using Rust and Anchor
- Create a frontend application to interact with your program using Astro and deploy it on Vercel

<br />
You don't need to have any prior experience with Solana or Rust to follow along.
We will be using Anchor, a framework that makes it easier to build smart contracts
on Solana.

## Prequisites

- [Install the Solana Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/de/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Install Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation#anchor)
